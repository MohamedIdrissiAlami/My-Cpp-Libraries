## My-Cpp-Libraries

Welcome to **My-Cpp-Libraries** ‚Äì a curated collection of C++ libraries designed to simplify and streamline common programming tasks. Developed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, these libraries are the result of practical experience solving real-world problems in C++ projects.

### üì¶ Library Modules

- **clsString**: Advanced string manipulation utilities.
- **clsDate**: Comprehensive date handling and operations.
- **clsUtil**: General-purpose utility functions.
- **clsInputValidate**: Robust input validation helpers.

### üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/My-Cpp-Libraries.git
   ```
2. **Include the desired header files** from the relevant folders in your C++ project.

### üìù About This Project

These libraries were created to provide reusable, modular solutions for frequent programming challenges. Each module is self-contained and can be integrated independently into your OOP-based C++ applications.


Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to these libraries. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud for his expert mentorship and practical teaching approach. His focus on structured, modular problem-solving and real-world programming has been invaluable to my learning. His platform, Programming Advices, has also deepened my understanding of advanced C++ concepts and best practices.
